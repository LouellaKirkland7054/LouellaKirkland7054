## Hi there 👋

Hey there! 👋 I’m a Go developer with a strong interest in building fast, efficient, and reliable software. This repository is part of my journey into developing command-line tools and deepening my understanding of concurrency in Go—two areas where the language really shines.

I enjoy working close to the system, creating lightweight utilities that simplify tasks, automate workflows, or enhance developer productivity. Go’s simplicity and speed make it a great choice for building CLI tools that are not only powerful but also easy to distribute and maintain.

In this repo, you’ll find a collection of projects and experiments focused on creating useful command-line interfaces, exploring standard libraries like flag, os, and cobra, and implementing features like argument parsing, file processing, and terminal output formatting.

Alongside tool-building, I’m also exploring Go’s robust concurrency model using goroutines and channels. I’ve been learning how to structure concurrent programs cleanly, manage synchronization with sync packages, and design systems that are both performant and safe from race conditions or deadlocks.

Each project here reflects what I’ve learned, with clear documentation and well-organized code. Whether you're a fellow Go enthusiast or someone curious about using Go for system tools and parallelism, I hope you’ll find something helpful or inspiring in this repository.

I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, and new ideas. Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute.

Thanks for stopping by—and happy coding with Go! ⚙️💻🚀
